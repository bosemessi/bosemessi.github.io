title: "Possession Chains - To survive or not to survive, that is the question."

Let me, as is the norm, start by pointing out the inspirations for writing this post. I was having discussions with [Paul Johnson](https://twitter.com/paul_johnson89) about how we could apply survival analysis in football, and he came up with this really cool idea of using survival analysis to investigate possession chains. Also, lots of Barcelona fans (myself included) are voicing dissatisfactions with how the team lacks composure and goes for unnecessary verticality especially in key Champions League games when things are not going their way - this is well documented in Domagoj Kostanjsak's article [here](https://barcafutbol.substack.com/p/how-verticality-intensity-and-defensive?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web). I finally had the impetus to do some quick checks and finally enter the rabbit hole of survival analysis properly. If you don't care about the rest of the article, this is how Barcelona has been faring over the years in terms of retaining possession for long durations.
