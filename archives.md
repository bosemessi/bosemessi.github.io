This page hosts some of my old works. Clicking through the links below will basically let you relive my journey through the world of football analytics. Most of the works have been created using [Statsbomb Open Data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data) and Python. I have made use of a host of interactive libraries like Bokeh, Holoviews, Panel, Param etc to create these interactive html files. Enjoy !!
