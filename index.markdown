My currently active works with football data are hosted here. Click on any of the links to be redirected to an interactive google colab notebook or a streamlit app to explore. Enjoy !! 

- Explore aggregrated data for top 5 European leagues, provided by [Statsbomb/fbref](https://fbref.com/en/) to create scatter charts, swarm plots and player radars here - [Statsbomb/Fbref Data Explorer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b1UZLMxuXV1aNl8HBE-oQ8gtb9Nk4-3U#scrollTo=d3GMGbIhLY5r). This is useful when you want to have a quick overview of a player's strengths and weaknesses. 

- Explore aggregrated data for midfielders/wingers/forwards in the top 5 leagues in 2019/20, provided by [Statsbomb/fbref](https://fbref.com/en/) to create radar charts, bar charts or violin plots here -  [Radar/barchart/violinplot app for midfielders/wingers/forwards in the top 5 leagues in 2019/20](https://aqueous-ocean-16355.herokuapp.com). This is useful when you want to have a quick overview of a player's strengths and weaknesses. This has been built with Streamlit.

- Explore the throw-in styles and success rates of teams from top 5 European leagues here - [An interactive case study of throw-ins](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LOX075r1L6kwlkfAZdhPPPTnG7QKddDM) 


- Explore dribble styles of Barcelona players here - [An interactive study of dribble styles](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zKjT0cLtHbhVo-r50VJu3MvoPhQNm6co). Built using Statsbomb Open Data. Will teach you the basics of clustering trajectories - an unsupervised machine-learning teachnique. 

- Explore quick passing combination styles of Barcelona players here - [An interactive study of quick passing combinations](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_A1VfcVTUclz5lc1OjIlcTvqI0upmaUe). Built using Statsbomb Open Data. Will teach you the basics of clustering trajectories - an unsupervised machine-learning teachnique. 


- Explore shooting profiles of top 5 European teams here - [An interactive study of team shot profiles](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18JGTv1Ek369E_N_Uys_lVPQYmY2q5d5q).Built using Understat data. This introduces " Inverse Pass Sonars" -  a new visualization idea I had the pleasure of developing along with [Jon Ollington](https://twitter.com/jonollington).

- Explore passing profiles of top 5 European teams here - [Team Pass Sonars](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y0vCoMX0xZMfv5vG1i1xPypXSf4f-eKl#scrollTo=9H1UGrJDvFXu). This looks at "Pass sonars" of all players in a team. You can choose any 11, arrange them in any formation you like, and plot out the pass sonars, all interactively.

- Explore automated match reports for any top 5 European league or Champions League games here - [Match Report](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y09NIdF2tEUdXRJ2R-APTG_DUA4E-pIM).
